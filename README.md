# Clustering-Iris-ML
The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark dataset widely utilized in machine learning and statistical analysis. 
It consists of 150 observations of three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. 
Each sample is described by four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, measured in centimeters. 
These features provide the physical characteristics of the flowers, enabling classification and clustering tasks.
In here this dataset used to test clustering algorithm
2 types of algorithms are used for clustering
KMeans algorithm 
Hierarchical Algorithmin 
In thses two algorithm KMeans provide 3 proper clusters and Hierarchichal clustering proven 5 clusatering points
